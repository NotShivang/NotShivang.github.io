My name is Shivang Arya and Iâ€™m currently pursuing a Master of Science degree in Information Technology and Management from the University of Texas at Austin.
!<br>
I am a curious introvert who is always ready to learn something new and tackle the next challenge. This curiosity led me to learn more about how technological developments impact businesses. In order to learn the correct way of implementing technology to help a business grow, I pursued my undergradute education as a combination of computer engineering and technology management. It was during this time that I realized the way companies use data to drive insights and decisions is really interesting and started taking steps to understand the statistics and algebra behind basic machine learning algorithms such as linear and logistic regression. This is when I decided to pursue a master's to improve my understanding of using technology and data from a business' perspective.

I spent the next few years learning about more algorithms and undertaking various projects that cover all aspects of data driven decision making, that is, collecting data, data extraction, transforming, loading, cleaning, modeling and deploying the the models on cloud platforms such as AWS and GCP for scalability.
